# 3. User Interface Design Goals

- **Overall UX Vision**: The user experience should be professional, intuitive, and efficient, visually styled after modern food delivery apps. The design should be clean and icon-driven, with a primary color scheme based on a light blue/sky blue theme.
- **Key Interaction Paradigms**: The primary user journey is a "Category-First" navigation model. The final, specific service required is defined by the customer within the booking request message.
- **Target Device**: Desktop Only.
