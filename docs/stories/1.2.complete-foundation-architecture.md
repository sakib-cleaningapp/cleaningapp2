# Story 1.2: Complete Foundation Architecture

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** Developer Team,
**I want** to complete the foundational architecture with all critical integrations (Prisma, tRPC, Shadcn/ui, Testing),
**so that** we have a fully functional, type-safe development foundation that matches our detailed architecture specifications and enables rapid feature development.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Prisma ORM is integrated with Supabase PostgreSQL
2. tRPC API layer is configured and functional with type safety
3. Shadcn/ui component library is set up and ready for use
4. Testing framework (Vitest + React Testing Library) is configured
5. Supabase project structure matches architecture specifications
6. Development tooling (Husky pre-commit hooks) is configured
7. Environment variable validation is implemented

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Critical Integration Story**: This story completes the foundational architecture by implementing the missing critical components identified in the comprehensive architecture review. [Source: architect technical plan]

**Technology Stack Completion**: Implements remaining components from tech-stack.md including Prisma (~5.12), tRPC (~11.0), Shadcn/ui, Vitest, and development tooling. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Data Model Implementation**: Prisma schema will implement the exact data models specified in architecture including Profile, Business, Service, and Booking entities with proper relationships. [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### Technical Requirements

**Critical Path Dependencies**: Database foundation (Prisma) must be completed before API layer (tRPC) can be implemented. UI foundation (Shadcn/ui) can run in parallel. [Source: architect dependency analysis]

**Type Safety**: All components must maintain end-to-end type safety from database through API to frontend, following the coding standard that "All frontend data access must go through defined tRPC procedures." [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Authorization Patterns**: tRPC implementation must follow the core principle that "All protected procedures must include authorization logic to verify that the logged-in user is the owner of or has explicit permission to access that data." [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

**Testing Strategy**: Vitest + React Testing Library setup must support both component testing and tRPC API testing to ensure comprehensive coverage. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure Notes

**Supabase Integration**: Must create proper `apps/supabase/` structure with functions, migrations, and config.toml to match source tree specifications. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Package Organization**:

- `packages/db/` - Prisma schema and client
- `packages/types/` - Shared TypeScript interfaces
- `packages/ui/` - Shadcn/ui components
- All following the coding standard for type sharing. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Risk Mitigation

**High-Risk Integrations**: tRPC + Prisma integration is complex. Start with simple router and expand gradually. If integration fails, fallback to traditional REST API temporarily. [Source: architect risk assessment]

**Development Environment**: Supabase CLI configuration can be complex. Document exact setup steps and use hosted Supabase for development if local setup fails. [Source: architect risk assessment]

### Testing

**Testing Standards**: Must implement Vitest + React Testing Library with example tests that demonstrate:

- Component testing patterns
- tRPC API testing utilities
- Database testing with Prisma
- Pre-commit hook validation

**Validation Criteria**: Story completion requires functional tests for database operations, API responses, UI component rendering, and successful pre-commit hook execution. [Source: architect validation criteria]

### Performance Considerations

**Database Performance**: Prisma schema must use proper indexing and relationships to support the booking workflow and search requirements from core-workflows.md. [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]

**Type Safety Performance**: tRPC configuration must maintain fast compilation times while providing full type safety across the stack. [Source: architect technical specifications]
