# Project Brief: Cleanly

### Executive Summary

Cleanly is a B2B marketplace web application designed to connect customers in South Wales with established, professional home service businesses. The platform addresses a gap in the market by focusing exclusively on vetted companies rather than individual freelancers, offering users a reliable and streamlined way to book services like cleaning, plumbing, and electrical work.

### Problem Statement

Current home service platforms in the UK primarily cater to freelancers. This leaves a significant gap for customers who prefer the reliability, professionalism, and accountability that comes with established businesses. These customers lack a simple, centralized platform to discover, compare, and book services from local professional companies.

### Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is a web-based marketplace, "Cleanly," that exclusively lists established and vetted home service businesses. It will feature a user-friendly interface for customers to browse, view profiles, and book appointments seamlessly. For business partners, it will provide a profile, a new customer acquisition channel, and a dashboard to manage booking requests.
